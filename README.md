# E-Commerce Back End- ORM

## Description

This application demonstrates the fundamental architecture of an e-commerce site back end. It uses seeded sample data with ability to create, retrieve, update, and delete data. It uses effective technologies to store sensitive data of the backend database. The application also demonstrates the use of associations to link related data in multiple tables. 

While developing this website, I learned about using a variety of tools and frameworks. I gained experience with MySQL2 and Sequelize packages to connect to a MySQL database. I practiced using the dotenv package to use environment variables to store sensitive data. I improved my skills working with APIs using CRUD operations for managing data. I also worked on testing the backend routes created via Postman.


## Usage

Review the Walkthrough Video which demonstrates functionality of this e-commerce back end application. The video includes creating the schema from MySQL shell, how to seed the database, how to start the application's server, use of the GET/POST/PUT/DELETE routes being tested in Postman for categories, products, and tags used within this application.
